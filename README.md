# Chatting_Application_Socket_Programming
main.py is the client application , server_ii.py is the server file
chat.py and name_window.py are the UI files 
to test the project please run server_ii.py then main.py

# Extra credit 
For the extra credit we implemented encryption as a server security, when messages are sent from the server to the client they are sent encrypted in the server and decrypted at the client and vice versa.
